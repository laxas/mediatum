## Quick Installation In Three Steps

This should work on all Linux distributions, possibly also on MacOS. You need the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix) (version > 1.8) to run this.
On non-NixOS machines, about 1,5GB disk space is required. On NixOS, about 1GB is required.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mediatum/mediatum`
2. Go to the mediatum directory: `cd mediatum`
3. Run mediaTUM: `./mediatum.py --force-test-db`

The last line in the output should say _Athana HTTP Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8081_.
You can visit `http://localhost:8081` now. Default login is *admin* with password *insecure*.

The last step downloads all missing dependencies, it may take some minutes on the first run. Dependencies are installed to `/nix/store`.
By default, database, upload and log files are written to `$HOME/mediatum_data`.

See `INSTALL.md` for more details on installation and usage.
